# Azure DevOps tools

## About
Migrating [my past playground](https://github.com/renansmoreira/devtools/tree/master/cli-tools/azuredevops-cli) with [Deno](deno.land) to Node.js, looking for a faster way to do some things in Azure DevOps without the website. Azure DevOps has an [official js client](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-node-api) and this one should not be taken seriously, I'm doing it just for fun.

## Docs
Will be better defined later.
